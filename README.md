# CIS524_Project

- This project shows the implementation of the Heap Sort algorithm to sort a list of student records by their exam scores. It is implemented in two different programming languages to show differences in programming paradigms and language design.

- The programming languages that are used in this Project are Java and JavaScript. In this Java represents the Imperative and Object-Oriented Paradigm while JavaScript represents Functional and Event Driven Paradigm.

- The compilers used in this are:
  1) Java
  - JDK Version: Java SE Development Kit 17
  - Compiler: javac
  - Interpreter: java
  
  2) JavaScript
  - Runtime: Node.js 
  - Interpreter: V8 Engine
  
- How to run and test the ccode:
  1) Java:
  - Compile the code:
     javac filename.java
  - Run the compiled code:
     java filename
  - Expected outcome:
    Sorted students by score:
    [Kathan: 95, Preet: 88, Jaishil: 85, Saurin: 85, Harsh: 72]

  2) JavaScript:
  - Run the Script:
     node filename.js
  - Expected Outcome:
     Sorted students by score:
      [
        { name: 'Kathan', score: 95 },
        { name: 'Preet', score: 87 },
        { name: 'Jaishil', score: 85 },
        { name: 'Saurin', score: 85 },
        { name: 'Harsh', score: 72 }
      ]
